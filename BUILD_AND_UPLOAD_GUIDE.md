## üöÄ Ready to Build and Upload

Your project is now ready for iOS builds! Follow these steps:

### Step 1: Login to EAS
```bash
eas login
```
Enter your Expo account credentials when prompted.

### Step 2: Build for iOS
```bash
eas build --platform ios --profile production
```

This will:
- Create a production iOS build
- Generate an IPA file
- Take about 10-15 minutes to complete

### Step 3: Upload to TestFlight
```bash
eas submit --platform ios --latest
```

This will:
- Upload your latest build to App Store Connect
- Make it available in TestFlight
- Require your Apple Developer credentials

### Alternative: Manual Upload
If you prefer to upload manually:

1. Download the IPA from the EAS build page
2. Open Xcode
3. Go to Window ‚Üí Organizer
4. Drag the IPA file into the Archives section
5. Select "Distribute App" ‚Üí "App Store Connect" ‚Üí "Upload"

## üì± TestFlight Setup

Once uploaded:

1. Go to [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com)
2. Navigate to your app ‚Üí TestFlight
3. Select the new build
4. Add internal testers (up to 100 people)
5. For external testing, you'll need Beta App Review
